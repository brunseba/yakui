# Icon Import Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution
Fixed the Material-UI icon import error: `The requested module doesn't provide an export named: 'NetworkingIcon'`

## Root Cause
The import statement in `CRDManager.tsx` was trying to import `NetworkingIcon` which doesn't exist in the Material-UI icons library.

## Fix Applied

### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
import {
  // ... other imports
  NetworkingIcon as NetworkIcon,
  // ... other imports
} from '@mui/icons-material';
```

### After (Correct):
```typescript
import {
  // ... other imports
  Router as NetworkIcon,
  // ... other imports
} from '@mui/icons-material';
```

## Verified Icons
All icons used in the component have been verified to exist in Material-UI:

| Icon Name | Usage | Status |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `Router` | Network/routing resources | ✅ Available |
| `Computer` | Core Kubernetes resources | ✅ Available |
| `Apps` | Application resources | ✅ Available |
| `Security` | RBAC/Security resources | ✅ Available |
| `Extension` | Custom/CRD resources | ✅ Available |
| `Schema` | Default/fallback icon | ✅ Available |
| `Storage` | Storage resources | ✅ Available |
| `ExpandMore` | Accordion controls | ✅ Available |
| `Visibility` | View details action | ✅ Available |
| `Public` | Cluster-scoped indicator | ✅ Available |
| `Language` | Namespaced indicator | ✅ Available |

## Component Usage
The `Router` icon (aliased as `NetworkIcon`) is used in the `getGroupIcon()` function to represent networking-related API groups:

```typescript
const getGroupIcon = (group: string) => {
  // ... other conditions
  if (group.includes('networking')) return <NetworkIcon />; // Uses Router icon
  // ... other conditions
};
```

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The Kubernetes Resource Manager component should now load without icon import errors.

## Testing
After clearing Vite cache and restarting the development server, the component should load successfully with all icons properly imported.
